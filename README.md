# 0xLibrary-Contracts
If you would like to have your work featured on 0xLibrary, then make a pull request to this repository with your suggestion. If your contract requires oracle servers and/or specialized supporting software, or a custom interface in order to work properly, all of that infrastructure will need to be maintained by the library without giving you direct access to the oracle for trust and security reasons. If this is the case, include a description of any complications or complexities required to make your contract work in your commit.

If your idea is good, I will make accomodations and work with you to make your contract work and integrate well with the site. 

<strong>95% of contract proceeds will go to the developer for the entire lifetime of the contract</strong>; include your ethereum wallet address in your pull request and specify which network (mainnet, optimism, or arbitrum) that you would like to have the contract deployed on.
