# 0xLibrary-Contracts
If you would like to have your work featured on 0xLibrary, then make a pull request to this repository with your suggestion. If your contract requires oracle servers and/or specialized supporting software, or a custom interface in order to work properly, all of that infrastructure will need to be maintained by the library for trust and security reasons. If this is the case, include a description of any complications or complexities required to make your contract work in your commit.

If your idea is good, I will make accomodations to make your contract work and integrate well with the site. 

95% of contract proceeds will go to the developer.
